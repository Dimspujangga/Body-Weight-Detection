# Digital Body Weight Detection

This project is designed to identify object detection from the scale and then the numeric digits on the digital weight scale will be detected when users measure their weight. This project utilizes OpenCV, PIL and YOLO V11 for precise object detection, especially for digit recognition on digital scales.
